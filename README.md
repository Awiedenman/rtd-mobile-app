# RTD-Mobile-App

the RTD-Mobile-App addresses the lack of functionality of the actual mobile app that the RTD provides. Using the google Directions API and a Rails backend, the RTD-Mobile-App allows users to easily look for train and bus connections all over Denver. The user then has the ability to Add a route to their favorites, which renders a quick select button for that particular connection.

## Goals

The RTD-Mobile-App was a project for our capstone at the [Turing School of Software and Design](https://www.turing.io/). Working with a two-person back-end team, our goal was to redesign the RTD app and make it more intuitive, as well as adding practical functionality for users returning to the app. The first sprint took 10 days. Future goals are removing bugs, increasing performance, and turning the RTD-Mobil-App into a PWA.
